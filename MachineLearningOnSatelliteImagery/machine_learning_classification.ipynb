    "## Task 1: Select Your Study Region and Year\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose **one study region of approximately 1,000-2,000 square kilometers** for your multi-classifier land cover analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suggested study regions with interesting land cover diversity:**\n",
    "- A major metropolitan area and its rural-urban fringe (e.g., Las Vegas, NV; Orlando, FL; Denver, CO)\n",
    "- An agricultural region with diverse crop types (e.g., Central Valley, CA; The Corn Belt in Iowa or Illinois)\n",
    "- A mountainous region with elevation-driven vegetation changes (e.g., The Rocky Mountains in Colorado; The Sierra Nevada in California)\n",
    "- A coastal region with a mix of wetlands, urban areas, and beaches (e.g., The Chesapeake Bay; The Mississippi River Delta)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Define your study area:**\n",
    "    - Create a polygon in Google Earth Engine that defines your study area. The area should be between 1,000 and 2,000 sq km.\n",
    "2.  **Select a year for your analysis:**\n",
    "    - Choose a recent year (e.g., 2020, 2021, 2022) for which good quality Landsat 8 imagery is available.\n",
    "3.  **Verify data availability:**\n",
    "    - Ensure that there is cloud-free Landsat 8 imagery for your chosen year and region."

    "- Add NDVI and NDWI as additional bands to your composite.\n",
    "- Use the ESA WorldCover dataset to create labeled training and testing data. You will need to remap the WorldCover classes to a smaller, more manageable set of classes (e.g., Water, Forest, Cropland, Urban, Barren).\n",
    "- Split your reference data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis B: Classifier Training and Application**\n",
    "- Train the following three classifiers using your training data:\n",
    "    - **Random Forest:** [`ee.Classifier.smileRandomForest`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/ee-classifier-smilerandomforest)\n",
