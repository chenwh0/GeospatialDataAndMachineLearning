    "- **Apply quality control masks** to remove cloud contamination and poor-quality pixels\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Notes:\n",
    "- For MODIS: Use both LST_Day_1km and LST_Night_1km bands from MOD11A2\n",

    "## Tips for Success\n",
    "\n",
    "**Study Area Selection:**\n",
    "- Desert cities show extreme LST values and strong urban heat islands\n",
    "- Cities with diverse land cover (urban, forest, agriculture, water) provide interesting comparisons\n",
    "- Consider seasonal factors (snow cover, growing season, monsoon patterns)\n",
    "- Coastal areas show maritime influence on thermal patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Tips:**\n",
    "- Start early to allow time for troubleshooting\n",
    "- Use the Inspector tool to verify your temperature values are realistic (typically -10°C to 60°C)\n",
    "- Double-check unit conversions (MODIS: multiply by 0.02, subtract 273.15; Landsat: subtract 273.15)\n",
    "- If maps appear blank, check your coordinate location, date ranges, and cloud cover filtering\n",
    "- For Landsat, use cloud cover threshold ≤ 20% and median compositing to reduce cloud contamination\n",
    "- Verify NDVI values are between -1 and 1; if not, check your band selections\n",
    "- Save your work frequently\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis Tips:**\n",
    "- Look for seasonal patterns (typically summer peaks, winter minimums)\n",
    "- Observe diurnal patterns (day LST usually 8-15°C warmer than night LST)\n",
    "- Consider what causes temperature differences (vegetation cooling, urban heat retention, water body effects)\n",
    "- Compare spatial patterns to land use maps or satellite imagery\n",
    "- Urban areas typically show reduced diurnal temperature range compared to rural areas\n",
    "\n",
    "**Report Tips:**\n",
    "- Always report temperatures in degrees Celsius (°C)\n",
    "- Include specific values (not just \"hot\" or \"cold\" - give actual temperatures)\n",
    "- Explain the difference between LST (surface skin temperature) and air temperature\n",
    "- Connect your thermal results to physical processes (evapotranspiration, thermal inertia, albedo)\n",
    "- Use proper figure captions (e.g., \"Figure 1: Seasonal day and night LST patterns in Phoenix, AZ for 2023 derived from MODIS MOD11A2 8-day composites\")\n",
    "- Discuss limitations (cloud cover, atmospheric effects, thermal vs. air temperature)\n",
    "- Proofread carefully before submission\n",
    "- Write clearly and concisely\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding LST Values:**\n",
    "- Summer daytime LST: 35-60°C (urban areas, bare soil, roofs)\n",
    "- Summer nighttime LST: 20-35°C\n",
    "- Winter daytime LST: 0-25°C (depends on latitude and climate)\n",
    "- Water bodies: Typically cooler and more stable\n",
    "- Dense vegetation: Typically 5-10°C cooler than urban areas during daytime\n",
    "- LST is NOT air temperature - surface can be 10-30°C warmer than air temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Help Resources\n",
    "\n",

    "- 16-day revisit, 100m spatial resolution (resampled from 120m native thermal)\n",
    "- Single-channel algorithm using Band 10 (ST_B10)\n",
    "- Requires emissivity correction based on NDVI\n",
    "- Already in Kelvin - subtract 273.15 for Celsius\n",
    "- Scale factors: 0.00341802 (multiplier), 149.0 (addend) for Collection 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**LST Retrieval Physics:**\n",
    "- Surface emissivity varies by land cover (0.95-0.99)\n",
    "- Vegetation has higher emissivity than bare soil/urban materials\n",
    "- Atmospheric correction is critical for accuracy\n",
    "- Diurnal cycle reflects surface energy balance and thermal inertia\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remember: This assignment builds on the LST analysis techniques demonstrated in class. The main challenge is adapting the code to your chosen study area and interpreting the thermal patterns in that regional context. Focus on creating meaningful visualizations and providing thoughtful analysis of the temperature patterns you observe. Only the 2-page report will be graded - everything else is for your learning process.*"
