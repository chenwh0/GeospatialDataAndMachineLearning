    "## Tips for Success\n",
    "\n",
    "**Study Area Selection:**\n",
    "- Choose areas with significant traffic or industrial activity for more interesting results\n",
    "- Consider seasonal factors (winter heating, summer photochemistry)\n",
    "- Urban areas typically show stronger NO₂ signals than rural locations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Tips:**\n",
    "- Start early to allow time for troubleshooting\n",
    "- Use the Inspector tool to verify your data values make sense\n",
    "- Check that your coordinates are correct and over your intended area\n",
    "- If charts appear blank, verify your date ranges and coordinate location\n",
    "- Save your work frequently\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis Tips:**\n",
    "- Look for seasonal patterns (typically winter peaks, summer minimums in many regions)\n",
    "- Consider what might cause peaks (rush hour effects averaged over monthly scales, heating seasons)\n",
    "- Compare your results between monthly and seasonal time scales\n",
    "\n",
    "**Report Tips:**\n",
    "- Include specific values (not just \"high\" or \"low\" - give actual mol/m² values)\n",
    "- Connect your results to local knowledge about your study area\n",
    "- Use proper figure captions (e.g., \"Figure 1: Monthly NO₂ concentrations in Chicago, IL...\")\n",
    "- Use scientific notation when appropriate (e.g., 2.5 × 10⁻⁵ mol/m²)\n",
    "- Proofread carefully before submission\n",
    "- Write clearly and concisely\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Help Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class materials**: Review the NO₂ analysis notebook for code examples\n",
    "- **GEE Documentation**: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/\n",
    "- **Dataset information**: Search for Sentinel-5P in the GEE data catalog\n",

    "*Remember: This assignment builds on the NO₂ analysis techniques demonstrated in class. The main challenge is adapting the code to your chosen study area and interpreting the results in that regional context. Focus on creating meaningful visualizations and providing thoughtful analysis of the patterns you observe. Only the 2-page report will be graded - everything else is for your learning process.*"

    "# **1. Select Study Region**\n",
    "The selected study area is Bakersfield, California, USA, with latitude 35.3733° N and longitude 119.0189° W. This area is at a unique location where surrounding mountains are known to trap pollution within the region. Bakersfield also experiences a broad range of nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) pollution sources, including transportation emissions, industrial activity from oil extraction and refining, agricultural operations, and dust. Moreover, the persistent demand for oil and agricultural production sustains continuous emissions of NO₂ and other air pollutants, intensifying local air quality challenges. The objective of this research is to understand and identify the connections between pollution spikes and their potential causes, whether they arise from seasonal variation, industrial activity, sensor errors, or a combination of these factors."

    "## Tips for Success\n",
    "\n",
    "**Study Area Selection:**\n",
    "- Choose areas with significant traffic or industrial activity for more interesting results\n",
    "- Consider seasonal factors (winter heating, summer photochemistry)\n",
    "- Urban areas typically show stronger NO₂ signals than rural locations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Tips:**\n",
    "- Start early to allow time for troubleshooting\n",
    "- Use the Inspector tool to verify your data values make sense\n",
    "- Check that your coordinates are correct and over your intended area\n",
    "- If charts appear blank, verify your date ranges and coordinate location\n",
    "- Save your work frequently\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis Tips:**\n",
    "- Look for seasonal patterns (typically winter peaks, summer minimums in many regions)\n",
    "- Consider what might cause peaks (rush hour effects averaged over monthly scales, heating seasons)\n",
    "- Compare your results between monthly and seasonal time scales\n",
    "\n",
    "**Report Tips:**\n",
    "- Include specific values (not just \"high\" or \"low\" - give actual mol/m² values)\n",
    "- Connect your results to local knowledge about your study area\n",
    "- Use proper figure captions (e.g., \"Figure 1: Monthly NO₂ concentrations in Chicago, IL...\")\n",
    "- Use scientific notation when appropriate (e.g., 2.5 × 10⁻⁵ mol/m²)\n",
    "- Proofread carefully before submission\n",
    "- Write clearly and concisely\n"
