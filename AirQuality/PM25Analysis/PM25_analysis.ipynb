    "\n",
    "The selected study area is Bakersfield, California, USA, with latitude 35.3733° N and longitude 119.0189° W. This area is at a unique location where its surrounding mountains may trap pollution within the region. There are also a broad range of pollution sources in Bakersfield, California, such as toxic farming chemicals, dust, transportation fumes, polluted winds from southern California, and Bakerfield\"s oil-drilling exhausts. Additionally, the risk of wildfire increases due to climate change. The objective of this research is to understand and find the connection between spikes of pollution and its potential cause whether it is because of season, industrial activity, wildfire, or a combination of these events."

    "### Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the workflow demonstrated in the class materials, create **three different visualizations** of PM2.5 data for your chosen location. You must adapt the code examples to your specific region and time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Analyses:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis A: Long-term Trend (MERRA-2 Dataset)**\n",
    "- Use MERRA-2 data for a **2-year period** (2020-2021 or 2021-2022)\n",
    "- Create a daily time series chart\n",
    "- Focus on identifying long-term patterns and unusual events\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis B: High-Resolution Monthly Analysis (GHAP Dataset)**  \n",
    "- Use GHAP data for **one full year** (choose from 2017-2022)\n",
    "- Create monthly aggregated PM2.5 chart\n",
    "- **CRITICAL:** Apply the 0.1 scale factor for proper unit conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis C: Seasonal Pattern Analysis**\n",
    "- Use either GHAP or MERRA-2 data\n",
    "- Create a seasonal comparison chart (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter)\n",
    "- Calculate seasonal averages for your location\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Adaptation Requirements:\n",
    "- **Change the coordinates** to your chosen city location\n",
    "- **Adjust time periods** as specified for each analysis\n",
    "- **Modify chart titles** to reflect your study area\n",
    "- **Ensure proper scale factors** are applied (especially for GHAP data)\n",
    "- **Use appropriate pixel scales** (1000m for GHAP, 50000m for MERRA-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Notes:\n",
    "- For MERRA-2: Use the dust component (DUCMASS25) or construct full PM2.5 using the formula shown in class\n",
    "- For GHAP: Must apply 0.1 scale factor to convert to μg/m³\n",
    "- Keep monthly aggregations to avoid computational limits"

    "\n",
    "**Study Area Selection:**\n",
    "- Choose areas with known air quality issues for more interesting results\n",
    "- Consider seasonal factors (wildfire seasons, winter heating, summer ozone)\n",
    "- Urban areas typically show more variation than rural locations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Tips:**\n",
    "- Start early to allow time for troubleshooting\n",
    "- Use the Inspector tool to verify your data values make sense\n",
    "- Double-check unit conversions (GHAP requires 0.1 scale factor)\n",
    "- If charts appear blank, check your coordinate location and date ranges\n",
    "- Save your work frequently\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis Tips:**\n",
    "- Look for seasonal patterns (typically winter peaks, summer minimums in temperate regions)\n",
    "- Consider what might cause spikes (wildfires, industrial events, weather patterns)\n",
    "- Compare your results across different time scales (daily vs monthly vs seasonal)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Report Tips:**\n",
    "- Include specific values (not just \"high\" or \"low\" - give actual μg/m³ values)\n",
    "- Connect your results to local knowledge about your study area\n",
    "- Use proper figure captions (e.g., \"Figure 1: Daily PM2.5 concentrations in Denver, CO...\")\n",
    "- Proofread carefully before submission\n",
    "- Write clearly and concisely"
