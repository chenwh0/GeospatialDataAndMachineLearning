    "## Tips for Success\n",
    "\n",
    "**Study Area Selection:**\n",
    "- Choose areas with clear land cover diversity (vegetation gradients, water bodies, urban/rural mix)\n",
    "- Avoid extremely cloudy regions (e.g., Pacific Northwest in winter)\n",
    "- Consider phenological timing - growing season for vegetation indices\n",
    "- Make sure your area has sufficient Sentinel-2 and Landsat coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Tips:**\n",
    "- **Save your GEE script frequently** using the \"Save\" button\n",
    "- Test your code on a small date range first before processing the full time series\n",
    "- Use `print(collection.size())` to verify you have images after filtering\n",
    "- If exports fail, try reducing `maxPixels` or increasing `scale`\n",
    "- **Download and save your exported GeoTIFF files immediately** - you need them for a302!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cloud Masking Tips:**\n",
    "- If you get too many black/no-data pixels, relax cloud filtering thresholds\n",
    "- For very cloudy regions, expand your date range or use a drier season\n",
    "- Check the true color composite before calculating indices to verify data quality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization Tips:**\n",
    "- Adjust `min` and `max` values in visualization parameters based on your landscape\n",
    "- Desert areas may have lower NDVI than forests - adjust accordingly\n",
    "- Urban areas may show negative NDVI - this is normal\n",
    "- Water bodies should show high (positive) NDWI values\n",
    "- Use the Inspector tool to click on features and check actual index values\n",
    "\n",
    "**Report Tips:**\n",
    "- Use clear figure captions that explain what is shown\n",
    "- Compare and contrast indices - don't just describe them individually\n",
    "- Relate patterns to real landscape features (e.g., \"high NDVI in forested areas\")\n",
    "- Be quantitative when possible (e.g., \"NDVI ranges from -0.1 to 0.7\")\n",
    "- Proofread carefully before submitting\n",
    "\n",
    "**File Organization for a302:**\n",
    "- Create a dedicated folder for your exported imagery\n",
    "- Use consistent, descriptive file names\n",
    "- Keep track of which sensor, date range, and area each file represents\n",
    "- **You MUST have these files for Assignment 3.02!**\n",

    "3. **Threshold Classification:** Create binary masks (e.g., water where NDWI > 0.2)\n",
    "4. **Histogram Analysis:** Use GEE's `ui.Chart.image.histogram()` to analyze index distributions\n",
    "5. **Multi-Sensor Comparison:** Export indices from both sensors and compare quantitatively\n",
