    "**Goal:** Demonstrate that you can relate terrain properties to different **land cover types** in your chosen region.\n",

    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. Load a recent **land cover dataset** for your region, such as:\n",
    "   - NLCD 2021 (for U.S. regions)\n",
    "   - Copernicus Global Land Cover (if you want global consistency or coarser resolution)\n",

    "   - TWI\n",
    "   - Roughness\n",
    "3. For that chosen derivative:\n",
    "   - Map it **by land cover type** (e.g., show slope values but only where land cover = cropland, forest, urban, wetland, etc.)\n",
    "   - Compute **mean values by class** (e.g., mean slope of cropland, forest, urban)\n",
    "4. Present your results:\n",
    "   - One **map** showing spatial patterns (or a set of small multiples)\n",
    "   - One **table** summarizing mean (and optionally min/max) values by land cover class\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discussion points (for your Results/Discussion sections):**\n",
    "- In a mountain region: Are forests concentrated on steeper, rougher slopes than croplands or urban areas?\n",
    "- In a valley or plateau region: Are irrigated croplands located on flatter, wetter terrain (higher TWI)?\n",
    "- In an urban corridor: Are developed areas avoiding very steep slopes?\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Colorado Front Range and plains (Rocky Mountains)**\n",
    "  - Slope and aspect constraints on urban expansion along the Front Range\n",
    "  - Landslide or rockfall susceptibility in steep mountain valleys\n",
    "  - Snow or solar suitability analysis using aspect and slope (e.g., south-facing slopes for solar, north-facing for snow retention)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Arizona/New Mexico Plateau (high desert and canyon country)**\n",
    "  - Flash flood-prone washes and canyons: low-slope valley bottoms with convergent flow (high TWI proxy)\n",
    "  - Rangeland erosion risk on sparsely vegetated, steep or highly rough terrain\n",
    "  - Solar farm siting: south-facing, moderately sloped terrain near existing infrastructure\n",

    "   - Example (ag): 0–2° = excellent; 2–6° = good; 6–12° = fair; etc.\n",
    "2. **Create a map** that shows your application output\n",
    "   - For example, classes of flood risk, suitability, erosion risk, or buildability\n",
    "3. **Quantify the results**\n",
    "   - Area (km²) or percentage of your region in each class\n",
    "   - Optionally, highlight a few key subregions (e.g., specific valleys, mountain ranges)\n",
