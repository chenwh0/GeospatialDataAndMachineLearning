# GeospatialDataAndMachineLearning

This repository contains remote sensing and geospatial analytics for data science applications. The code imports multi-temporal satellite imagery, and aerial data and executes on Google Earth Engine (a cloud-based platform), to analyze environmental patterns across time, land use changes, vegetation dynamics, and air quality conditions.

# Application

Real-world issues in environmental monitoring, climate research, and public health were addressed in each application to consider how data results could aid in decision-making and planning processes.
