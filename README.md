# GeospatialDataAndMachineLearning
This repository contains remote sensing and geospatial analytics for data science applications. The code imports multi-temporal satellite imagery, and aerial data and executes on Google Earth Engine (a cloud-based platform), to analyze environmental patterns across time, land use changes, vegetation dynamics, and air quality conditions.
